<p>In an attempt to make it big as a web developer, I thought it would be best to have a website that really brings out the best in my abilities. This page was initially designed to tinker with and experiment with different technologies and skills. So what better than to tinker and prod. I plan on modifying this site more and more as time goes on to accomodate different needs and overall serve as my blog and portfolio.</p>

<p>What? A Blog? They still exist?</p>

<p>Yes, and I feel like turning this website into a hub for all things I’m passionate about is a great idea for me to expand in all my interests. So whether you’ve seen my old sites before or you’re clicking on this one for the first time. I welcome you for the bumpy ride.</p>

<p>P.S You can also contact me through GitHub, Email and soon enough directly from the site itself.</p>
