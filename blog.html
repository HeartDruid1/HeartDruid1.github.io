      <p>The download page is up and has a few links and should be up and working. The links should all redirect to their respective
      Google Drive pages. If any of the links are broken. You can notify me from my Twitter page.</p>

      <h2>The Site is LIVE!</h2>
      <p>This site is finally up and if you're reading this I'm being held captive at the warehouse on the corner of 3rd and 4th... no but really, if you're on this site you either came across it by accident
      or clicked on the link embeded on my Instagram or Twitter pages. So... what's the deal? What's with the dude taking up server space? Well, I wanted a site to blog post and share source code to projects that I work on
      while I explore the weird and wonderful world of computer programming. If you would like to support me (and maybe give suggestions or tips which are greatly appreciated), you can always check out my GitHub and Twitter accounts where the links to those can be found on the home page.</p>
