			<h2>CyberSpace</h2>
			<p>CyberSpace is my first fully fledged game with colourful graphics in a GUI. Use the arrow keys to move your space ship to dodge the oncoming obstacles. 100% Free Range, Gluten-Free, Vegan Friendly.<a href="https://github.com/HeartDruid1/CyberSpace">Click Here</a></p>
			<h2>Final Fight</h2>
			<p>Final Fight is a fighting game written in Python3 (so having that installed is needed to run it). The game is played in the CLI so either in your command prompt or in IDLE. The game features plenty of pop culture references and challenging gameplay. Turn based gameplay similar to RPGs of the 80s and 90s. Soon to be a basis for a project using Pygame or Pyglet.<a href="https://github.com/HeartDruid1/Final-Fight">Click Here</a></p>
			<h2>Basic Python Twitter Bot</h2>
			<p>This Twitter bot written in Python 3 tweets a message made up of randomly selected words from a .csv file
      (which can be written in Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet software) and tweets the message at 15 minute intervals
      with a handy countdown clock that counts every minute in the command line and when the message tweets the command line will print
      it in the command line. *Due to issues with Twython (which is a required library) the script crashes after an hour*

			<h2>Minecraft Pi Chat GUI</h2>
			<p>This one is a little different and requires a Raspberry Pi, Minecraft Pi, and the guizero library for Python3.5.2. This is a very simple and basic script that demonstrates how Python and GUIs can be used in unison with additional software. It works like so, you click on the text box and type the message you wish to post to the chat board and press the provided push button to post. The script may also be easily modified to run with Twython and be used as a custom Twitter application. It's a piece of cake... or rather "Pi" ;)
