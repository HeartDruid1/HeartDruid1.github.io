			<h2>I CAN HAS LOLCODE?</h2>
			<h6>September 19, 2017</h6>
			<p>As always I'm late to the party but lately I've been experimenting with LOLCODE. Take it serious or as a joke but in reality, you can do some pretty cool things with dead memes that have turned into esoteric programming languages. I started a repo to share some exmples of what stupid-fun things can be done with LOLCODE. And if you want to try it for yourself, there's an online compiler on repl.it <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a></p>
			<h2>New Stuff, Tell All Your Friends!</h2>
			<h6>September 12, 2017</h6>
			<p>After nearing completion of my pride and joy "CyberSpace" I decided that a new project was due. So I'm working on finishing CyberSpace and starting a new project in the style of a top down shooter. Just because school is in session doesn't mean I can't work on cool stuff. The game still is only in the alpha stage and doesn't have much more than a working title but I'm excited to tell you about this super cool fun thing that's free... like for real! Stay tuned for more cool stuff.</p>
			<h2>Full Elinks Compatibility!</h2>
			<h6>August 23, 2017</h6>
			<p>If you're like me and have an absolutely terrible and slow computer, you'll do anything to use the least system resources as possible... Well when I'm doing web development, sometimes using a regular browser like Firefox or Chromium just isn't fast enough. That's why I've started using Elinks for that. Elinks is a CLI based web browser that makes you look like those UBER HAXORZ and because of this site's simplistic layout you won't be missing any of the "glory" when viewing this in a CLI based web browser!</p>
			<h2>My Toolbox</h2>
			<h6>August 18, 2017</h6>
			<p>Since it's a huge subject to controversy, I figured I'd make a list of the primary tools I use regularly while programming
				<ul>
					<li>Vim Text Editor (Emacs sucks ;) )</li>
					<li>Linux Mint (although considering switching to Arch in the future... Arch Linux Master Race!)</li>
					<li>GitKraken/Git Cola as git clients</li>
					<li>SeaMonkey web browser (built in tools for web development and it sounds cool)</li>
					<li>GIMP & ASEPRITE for drawing and photo editing tools</li>
					<li>Clementine Media Player (for intense concentration tunes)</li>
				</ul></p>
			<h2>Houston, we have git!</h2>
			<h6>August 18, 2017</h6>
			<p>As I'm running 32 bit Linux Mint, my favourite git client is not an option (GitKraken) and I haven't been able to find one that I really liked, until now. I found 'git cola' and so far it seems to do exactly what GitKraken is able to. This is actually a test post to see the capabilities of 'git cola'. If it works out well I might just have found a new git client ;)</p>
			<h2>Website Redesign</h2>
			<h6>August 12, 2017</h6>
			<p>The last layout of the website didn't respond well on mobile (sorry guys) so I decided to redo the website with a simplistic design inspired by Bryan Lunduke's Website. Hopefully with this new and improved website things can be more efficient and easier to use.</p>
			<h2>FREE STUFF! (As in Free Beer and Free Speech)</h2>
			<h6>June 30, 2017</h6>
			<p>The Downloads page is up and running with a few small projects, feel free to download and modify my code however you like. The world is your oyster!</p>
			<h2>The Site is LIVE!!!</h2>
			<h6>June 24, 2017</h6>
			<p>This site is finally up and if you're reading this I'm being held captive at the warehouse on the corner of 3rd and 4th... no but really, if you're on this site you either came across it by accident or clicked on the link embedded on my Instagram or Twitter pages. So... what's the deal? What's with the dude taking up server space? Well, I wanted a site to blog post and share source code to projects that I work on while I explore the weird and wonderful world of computer programming. If you would like to support me (and maybe give suggestions or tips which are greatly appreciated), you can always check out my GitHub and Twitter accounts where the links to those can be found on the home page.</p>
