      I am currently a high school student who is a computer enthusiast. I plan to study computer science in university
      to make a career out of working in computers. However, for now I rely on the wonderful void of the internet and
      my school's computer science class. The point of this website is to work as a personal blog (mostly tech related)
      and to post small projects I've been working on. Feedback is most certainly appreciated as well as checking out my
      GitHub and Twitter accounts.
