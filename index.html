			<h2>IRC channels are in, sort of?</h2>
			<h6>January 23, 2018 (Updated Jan 28, 2018)</h6>
			<p>In our day and age communication is at no shortage, with Facebook, Snapchat and Discord, people are more connected than ever but what if you want to revisit the days of chat rooms and IRC? Well look no further because I just opened a channel. More instructions are available on the IRC page. I'm doubtful that people will really use this but it's option and I will likely be connected to the room as long as I'm not asleep...</p>
			<h2>What do bloggers blog about?</h2>
			<h6>January 13, 2018</h6>
			<p>I've been running this page for almost a year and one thing that I found was that I don't really have anything relevant to post. I mean this was meant to be a project sharing page but it gets boring when all I post is "Hey I fixed this bug and added this 'groundbreaking new feature'" like that's it... I should do something a little more immersive like maybe Open Source product suggestions or stuff like that... Similar to MakeUseOf or OMG Ubuntu! or maybe some music suggestions since I am heavily into underground music and the like. I think that sounds like a good idea.<br/>P.S Does anyone read this? If so, you should give me a shout.</p>
			<h2>Happy Holidays</h2>
			<h6>December 26, 2017</h6>
			<p>Happy Holidays everyone, I hope you all had a great time celebrating whatever yearly traditions you celebrate. With the new year rapidly approaching, the common trend is to make a resolution to better yourself (new year new me). I'm among those that hardly follow those self enforced disciplines however I suppose the least I could do is commit more. If you haven't checked the download page recently then you haven't seen the newest addition to my GitHub page... Yes, a new game! The same game talked about on the last post, it's still in its early stages so don't get your hopes up too much but eventually it will have all the bells and whistles. Stay posted for new updates and have a happy new year!</p>
			<h2>I'm Blue</h2>
			<h6>November 6, 2017</h6>
			<p>If it wasn't too obvious the website is blue! Why change the entire color scheme? On some (most) monitors the greenish tint shows as really dark which brings a very annoying viewing experience. So... How have you been? It's been a while since I've made any Commits or Posts. No, I'm not dead (although the ammount of schoolwork I have says otherwise) but just busy. Pretty soon I plan on getting a WiFi adapter so I can stay connected a little bit better and even get more work done on my latest project. I've got a whole team on board, artwork, storyline, this has it all! Stay posted for more updates.</p>
			<h2>I CAN HAS LOLCODE?</h2>
			<h6>September 19, 2017</h6>
			<p>As always I'm late to the party but lately I've been experimenting with LOLCODE. Take it serious or as a joke but in reality, you can do some pretty cool things with dead memes that have turned into esoteric programming languages. I started a repo to share some exmples of what stupid-fun things can be done with LOLCODE. And if you want to try it for yourself, there's an online compiler on repl.it <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a></p>
			<h2>New Stuff, Tell All Your Friends!</h2>
			<h6>September 12, 2017</h6>
			<p>After nearing completion of my pride and joy "CyberSpace" I decided that a new project was due. So I'm working on finishing CyberSpace and starting a new project in the style of a top down shooter. Just because school is in session doesn't mean I can't work on cool stuff. The game still is only in the alpha stage and doesn't have much more than a working title but I'm excited to tell you about this super cool fun thing that's free... like for real! Stay tuned for more cool stuff.</p>
			<h2>Full Elinks Compatibility!</h2>
			<h6>August 23, 2017</h6>
			<p>If you're like me and have an absolutely terrible and slow computer, you'll do anything to use the least system resources as possible... Well when I'm doing web development, sometimes using a regular browser like Firefox or Chromium just isn't fast enough. That's why I've started using Elinks for that. Elinks is a CLI based web browser that makes you look like those UBER HAXORZ and because of this site's simplistic layout you won't be missing any of the "glory" when viewing this in a CLI based web browser!</p>
			<h2>My Toolbox</h2>
			<h6>August 18, 2017 (Updated Jan 23, 2018)</h6>
			<p>Since it's a huge subject to controversy, I figured I'd make a list of the primary tools I use regularly while programming
					<p><br/>-Vim Text Editor and Geany (For lightweight IDE features and because Emacs sucks)</p>
					<p>-Linux Mint (although considering switching to Arch in the future... Arch Linux Master Race!)</p>
					<p>-Git Cola as a git client</p>
					<p>-SeaMonkey web browser (built in tools for web development and it sounds cool)</p>
					<p>-GIMP & ASEPRITE for drawing and photo editing tools</p>
					<p>-Rhythmbox Media Player (for intense concentration tunes)</p>
					<p>-HexChat and Pidgin for chat clients</p>
			</p>
			<h2>Houston, we have git!</h2>
			<h6>August 18, 2017</h6>
			<p>As I'm running 32 bit Linux Mint, my favourite git client is not an option (GitKraken) and I haven't been able to find one that I really liked, until now. I found 'git cola' and so far it seems to do exactly what GitKraken is able to. This is actually a test post to see the capabilities of 'git cola'. If it works out well I might just have found a new git client ;)</p>
			<h2>Website Redesign</h2>
			<h6>August 12, 2017</h6>
			<p>The last layout of the website didn't respond well on mobile (sorry guys) so I decided to redo the website with a simplistic design inspired by Bryan Lunduke's Website. Hopefully with this new and improved website things can be more efficient and easier to use.</p>
