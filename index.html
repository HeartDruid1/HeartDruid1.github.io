			<h2>Website Redesign</h2>
			<p>The last layout of the website didn't respond well on mobile (sorry guys) so I decided to redo the website with a simplistic design inspired by Bryan Lunduke's Website. Hopefully with this new and improved website things can be more efficient and easier to use.</p>
			<h2>FREE STUFF! (As in Free Beer and Free Speech)</h2>
			<p>The Downloads page is up and running with a few small projects, feel free to download and modify my code however you like. The world is your oyster!</p>
			<h2>The Site is LIVE!!!</h2>
			<p>This site is finally up and if you're reading this I'm being held captive at the warehouse on the corner of 3rd and 4th... no but really, if you're on this site you either came across it by accident or clicked on the link embedded on my Instagram or Twitter pages. So... what's the deal? What's with the dude taking up server space? Well, I wanted a site to blog post and share source code to projects that I work on while I explore the weird and wonderful world of computer programming. If you would like to support me (and maybe give suggestions or tips which are greatly appreciated), you can always check out my GitHub and Twitter accounts where the links to those can be found on the home page.</p>
