## NAQ (Never Asked Questions)

### Why does this repo need a README?
It doesn't?

### What is this repo?
It's the repo that stores all the data I need for my website

### What's the website for?
It's a site that I use as a neat little place to post updates about projects that I happen to be working on, or random blog posts that I feel are relevant. That and it looks good to others when they see that you have a website.

### Why does it look so crappy?
First of all, rude. Secondly, it's plain because I stare at black screens with green text in my mother's basement so having a simplistic website lets me view it within a terminal so I don't have to get sticky fingers with GUIs (gooey).

### Can I take ideas from this website and use it in my own?
Yeah, sure. It's open source so take all you want, all websites are technically open source. (Press F12)
