## NAQ (Never Asked Questions)

### Why does this repo need a README?
It doesn't?

### What is this repo?
It's the repo that stores all the data for when I do a complete overhaul of my website. It's the development branch because... organization?

### What's the website for?
It's a site that I use as a neat little place to post updates about projects that I happen to be working on, or random blog posts that I feel are relevant. That and it looks good to others when they see that you have a website (can't confirm though).

### Why does it look less crappy than your old site?
You're right, the old one did look pretty crappy... Unless you looked at it in a terminal, then it looked majestic as frig. However, the new one is designed with some cutting edge technology that is eye opening and innovative... Just kidding, it's CSS...

### Can I take ideas from this website and use it in my own?
Yeah, sure. It's open source so take all you want, all websites are technically open source. (Press F12)
